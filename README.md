# Playing-Games-with-Reinforcement-Learning
This is my bachelor's final project. It focuses on developing a model that can play simple games, like Atari games, using Reinforcement Learning. The project serves as more of a demonstration than a new model. 

More detailed information about the model and how it works can be found in the *PlayingGameswithReinforcmentLearing.pdf*.
